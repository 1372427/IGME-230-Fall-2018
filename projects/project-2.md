# Project 2 - Web Service Application (DRAFT)

## I. Overview

For this project you (and optionally a partner) are creating a JavaScript driven Web application that utilizes a Web service.
- Your goal is to create an interactive HTML5 Media Experience or DOM Game that is easy to use, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.

- Ideally the experience will run in all modern browsers, but at a bare minimum it must run in recent versions of Chrome.

- The objective of this project is for you to demonstrate your mastery of HTML5/CSS/JS programming in a rich media context. 

- You will be evaluated on:
    - your creativity
    - the quality of the experience you create
    - the soundness of your programming
    - how far you went beyond what we did in class, as described below.
    
- Resources:
    - Our Web apps series: [Web Apps 0 - About this Web App Tutorial Series](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-0.md)
    - [GIF Finder HW](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-gif-finder.md) covers most of what you need to know
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

## II. Requirements

### A. Functional
1. Your application will utilize a web service from this list:
    - https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
        - do not use any API that requires *OAuth* authentication
        - if an API requires an API Key, be sure that there is a "free tier" and no trial period
    - ...
2. You will save the last term searched by the user in the browser local storage - this was covered here: [Web Apps 9 - WebStorage API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md)
3. There will be no JavaScript errors or exceptions thrown by the app.

### B. Design & Interaction
- Pleasing graphic design
- Widgets are well labeled
- User should be able to figure out how to use the app with minimal instruction (and be sure to provide instruction and tooltips if necessary!), and user errors are handled gracefully.
- While it doesn't need to be responsive, it should look good on a range of displays; don't design it just to work on your huge 24" screen at home (as I'll be grading it on my MacBook with a much smaller screen). The main controls of the application must fit in a 800x600 window.

### C. HTML/CSS
- Valid HTML5 - https://validator.w3.org
- Valid CSS - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- Most CSS is in an external style sheet.
- Use HTML5 semantic and structural elements where practical.
- you ARE allowed to use CSS frameworks on the UI for this (and future) projects, such as:
    - http://getbootstrap.com
    - http://materializecss.com
    - https://purecss.io
    - https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks

### D. Media
- Images are properly optimized for Web delivery.

### E. Code Conventions
- `let` and `const` (no `var`!)
- `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` for DOM traversal (DO NOT use the older methods)
- D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself. Repeated blocks of nearly identical code should be factored out and placed in a separate function.
- Variable and function names must begin with a lowercase letter.
- Well-commented code. Each and every function gets a comment indicating what it does.
- Delete or comment out your `console.log()` calls.

## III. Milestones
- Project proposal with mockup - see myCourses for due date/time. One submission per team please. Make sure both team members' names are included.
- Final project deliverable - see myCourses for due date/time. One submission per team please. Again, make sure both team members' names are included.

## IV. Documentation
- As with Project 1, include a Documentation page (put the link in the comments field of the dropbox) where you document your process, cite any sources, tell me where to find anything special you want me to see, and also explain how you met the requirements. Finally, give yourself a grade for the project that you feel fairly represents what its worth.
- If you worked in a team, explain what each team member did. Remember, everyone is responsible for contributing throughout the project, not just to one aspect.

## V. Grading
- *Both* partners must contribute *both* JavaScript code AND HTML/CSS to the project. This is NOT a project where team members are allowed to specialize into "Art Director" and "Software Developer" roles! Both team members shall be "Artist/Coders" (doing both) for this project.

Your project will be graded on the following criteria:

| Criteria | Weight | Your Score |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| **Functionality** | **40** | |
|  - Is useful and/or entertaining | |
|  - Demonstrates creativity | |
|  - Runs without errors | |
| **Design & Interaction** | **20** | |
|  - Visual design is pleasing | |
|  - Interface is clear and well labeled | |
|  - Prevents and handles errors well | |
| **HTML/CSS/Media**  | **10** | |
|  - HTML and CSS validate | |
|  - CSS is primarily in a single external stylesheet | |
|  - Makes proper use of structural tags, etc. | |
| **Code**  | **10** | |
|  - Code is well formatted and commented, and follows coding standards | |
| **Documentation** | **10** | |
| **Above and Beyond (see below)** | **10** | |
| **Possible Total Points** | **100** | |
| Deduction if initial checkpoint is not submitted to dropbox on time | -10 | |

Note:
- **Good** (Meet all requirements above reasonably well) = 90%
- **Better** (Go beyond expectations in 2 or more areas) = 95%
- **Best** (Go significantly beyond expectations in 2 or more areas) = 100%

## VI. Submission
- ZIP and post the completed project and documentation page to to the mycourses dropbox
- Post the project to banjo and link it from your 230 home page (exception: do not post *Music Finder* to the web)
